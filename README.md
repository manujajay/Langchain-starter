## Basic Usage Examples

### Simple Chatbot Example

This example demonstrates how to create a simple chatbot using Langchain.

```python
from langchain.chains import Chain
from langchain.schema import OpenAI

# Initialize the language model (assuming OpenAI's GPT-3 or compatible API)
language_model = OpenAI(api_key="your_api_key")

# Create a simple response chain
chain = Chain(language_model)

# Generate a response
response = chain.run("Hello! How can I help you today?")
print(response)
```
